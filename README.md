## Plans:
- [ ] Learn how does GAN work
- [ ] Learn how does Transformers work
- [ ] Finish technotrack's lectures and seminars, do all homeworks
- [ ] Look throught the Tinkoff's lectures
- [ ] Refactor cloudiness estimation project
- [x] Check if TorchLigtning trainer is faster than mine
- [x] Learn how autoencoders work
- [x] Autograd tricks
- [x] Learn how tensorboard works
- [x] Write own threaded data-management(realised in metrics learning)
