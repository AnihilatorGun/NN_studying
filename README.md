# Hi! This repo represents my way of studying DeepLearning
____
## Resources that I use:
+ [Technotrack 2021](https://github.com/mailcourses/technotrack-NN2021S-lectures)
+ [HSE DeepLearning](https://github.com/hse-ds/iad-deep-learning/tree/master/2022)
+ [MIPT DeepLearningSchool](https://github.com/DLSchool/deep-learning-school)
+ [Tinkoff course](https://algocode.ru/dlfall22/)
+ [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/index.html)
+ [Other guides](https://github.com/ahmedbahaaeldin/From-0-to-Research-Scientist-resources-guide)

## Plans:
- [ ] Learn how does Transformers work
- [ ] Finish technotrack's lectures and seminars, do all homeworks
- [ ] Look throught the Tinkoff's lectures
- [ ] Refactor cloudiness estimation project
- [x] Learn how does GAN work
- [x] Check if TorchLigtning trainer is faster than mine
- [x] Learn how autoencoders work
- [x] Autograd tricks
- [x] Learn how tensorboard works
- [x] Write own threaded data-management(realised in metrics learning)
----
## Building blocks:
- [ ] Transformer
- [ ] Knoledge distillation
- [x] GAN(not at all, still studying)
- [x] Metric learning (almost done, cosmetic changes left)
- [x] Autoencoders
- [x] Saliency map
____
## Pet projects:
- [ ] Cloudiness estimation
- [x] Face recognition
